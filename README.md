# GoScrapper

This project will probably keep pretty simple, but I may do more websites and more complex structs in the future.

I started this because I already had this code in python, but it was really really slow, and the library that I was using would open the browser on my computer to be able to scrap, which is atrocious from my point of view and take a lot of time.

For now it only access some MMORPG sites and retrieve info, keep in mind that I'll probably add it to my bot later.
